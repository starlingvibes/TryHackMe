<H2>If you are just browsing the web</h2>

<P>The owner of this web site has not put up any web pages yet.
Please come back later.</P>

<P><SMALL><CITE>Move along, nothing to see here...</CITE> :-)</SMALL></P>

<P>If you want to report something about this host's behavior, please
contact the Internet Service Provider (ISP) involved directly.</P>

<P>See the <A href="http://www.abuse.net/">Network Abuse

<H2>If you are the administrator of this machine</H2>

<P>The initial installation of <A href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian's
apache-ssl</A> web server package was successful.</P>

<P><STRONG>You should replace this page with your own web pages as
soon as possible.</STRONG></P>

<P>Unless you changed its configuration, your new server is configured as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
Configuration files can be found in <TT>/etc/apache-ssl</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>DocumentRoot</TT>, which is the directory under which all your
HTML files should exist, is set to <TT>/var/www</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
CGI scripts are looked for in <TT>/usr/lib/cgi-bin</TT>, which is where
Debian packages will place their scripts.</LI>

<LI>
Log files are placed in <TT>/var/log/apache-ssl</TT>, and will be rotated
weekly.  The frequency of rotation can be easily changed by editing
<TT>/etc/logrotate.d/apache-ssl</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
The default directory index is <TT>index.html</TT>, meaning that requests
for a directory <TT>/foo/bar/</TT> will give the contents of the file <TT>/var/www/foo/bar/index.html</TT>
if it exists (assuming that <TT>/var/www</TT> is your <TT>DocumentRoot</TT>).</LI>

<LI>
User directories are enabled, and user documents will be looked for
in the <TT>public_html</TT> directory of the users' homes.  These dirs
should be under <TT>/home</TT>, and users will not be able to symlink
to files they don't own.</LI>

</UL>
All the standard apache-ssl modules are available with this release and are
now managed with debconf.  Type <TT>dpkg-reconfigure apache-ssl</TT> to
select which modules you want enabled.  Many other modules are available
through the Debian package system with the names <TT>libapache-mod-*</TT>.
If you need to compile a module yourself, you will need to install the
<TT>apache-dev</TT> package.

<P>More documentation on Apache can be found on:
<UL>
<LI>
The <A HREF="/doc/apache-doc/manual/">Apache documentation</A> stored on your server.</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Project</A> home site.</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="http://www.apache-ssl.org/">Apache-SSL</A> home site.</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="http://perl.apache.org/">mod perl</A> home site.</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="http://www.apacheweek.com/">ApacheWeek</A> newsletter.</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/doc/">Debian Project
Documentation</A> which contains HOWTOs, FAQs, and software updates.</LI>
</UL>

<P>You can also consult the list of <A HREF="http://www.boutell.com/faq/">World
Wide Web Frequently Asked Questions</A> for information.

<H2>Let other people know about this server</H2>

<A HREF="http://netcraft.com/">Netcraft</A> provides an interesting free
service for web site monitoring and statistic collection.
You can let them know about your server using their
<A HREF="http://uptime.netcraft.com/">interface</A>.
Enabling the monitoring of your server will provide a better global overview
of who is using what and where, and it would give Debian a better
overview of the apache package usage.
